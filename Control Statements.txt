#4.A toy vendor supplies three types of toys: Battery Based Toys, Key-based Toys, and Electrical Charging Based Toys.
 The vendor gives a discount of 10% on orders for battery-based toys if the order is for more than Rs. 1000.
 On orders of more than Rs. 100 for key-based toys, a discount of 5% is given, and a discount of 10% is given on orders for electrical
 charging based toys of value more than Rs. 500. Assume that the numeric codes 1,2 and 3 are used for battery based toys, key-based toys,
 and electrical charging based toys respectively. Write a program that reads the product code and the order amount and prints out the 
 net amount that the customer is required to pay after the discount.
